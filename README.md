# Credit Card Number Extraction Using Digital Image Processing

This project was developed as part of **ENGI 9804 - Industrial Machine Vision** and focuses on extracting credit card numbers from images using digital image processing techniques. The implementation relies on Python and the OpenCV library to achieve accurate results without the use of machine learning, making it suitable for devices with limited computational resources.

Extracting credit card data involves identifying and processing details like the card number, expiry date, and cardholder name from an image. This project focuses solely on extracting the credit card number using image processing techniques to ensure compatibility with resource-constrained devices. The implementation follows a step-by-step process that includes resizing, smoothing, sharpening, and adaptive thresholding for reliable results.
